  Sources:
    # Copy and customize the SourceTemplate section for each Record and Replay source that you want to create.
    # Rename the section title 'SourceTemplate' to be the name of your Record and Replay source. This name must be unique.
    # If you have set 'eventFormat: MonitoringEventV2' for monitoring events, the value of the topic property takes the form: $SYS/Broker/integration_server/Monitoring/integrationServer/application/library/msgFlow ,where integrationServer, application, library, and msgFlow represent the names of your integration server, application, library, and message flow. The library name is optional and will be required only if the message flow is inside a library.
    # If you have set 'eventFormat: WMB' for monitoring events, the value of the topic property takes the form: $SYS/Broker/integration_server/Monitoring/integrationServer/msgFlow, where integrationServer, and msgFlow represent the names of your integration server, and message flow.
    # You can use wildcards in the topic property; for more information about using wildcards in topic strings, see "Special characters in topics" topic in the Knowledge Center.
    # A durable subscription is created for each source and is created with a subid of IntegrationServer:[servername]:[sourcename]. If multiple independent integration servers share the same queue manager, you must ensure that there is no clash in server and source name.
    # If you delete a source, you must manually delete the durable subscription for that source to avoid messages being published to the Record and Replay store's queue.
    #SourceTemplate:
      #topic: '$SYS/Broker/integration_server/Monitoring/[servername]/[applicationname]/[flowname]'  # Sets the monitoring event topic string that is used when record and replay subscribes to monitoring events, see above.
      #store: 'StoreTemplate' # The Record and Replay store that is used to configure record and replay for the message flows specified in the topic property. Multiple instances of Record and Replay source can refer to one instance of a Record and Replay store.

  Destinations:
    # Copy and customize the MQDestinationTemplate section for each Record and Replay destination that you want to create.
    # Rename the section title 'MQDestinationTemplate' to be the name of your Record and Replay destination. This name must be unique.
    # For destinations of type WMQDestination, the value of the property takes the form: wmq:/msg/queue/queueName@queueManagerName, where queueName identifies the destination queue and queueManagerName identifies the queue manager that owns the queue. The queue manager name is optional, with the default queue manager (local or remote) being used if it is not specified. Only local queue managers can be specified by name.
    #MQDestinationTemplate:
      #endpointType: 'WMQDestination'             # The type of the target destination to which messages will be replayed. The default is WMQDestination, which is the only valid value.
      #endpoint: 'wmq:/msg/queue/[QUEUE]@[QMGR]'  # The destination to which you want to replay data. This property is mandatory. The default value is wmq:/msg/queue/[QUEUE]@[QMGR]. You must replace [QUEUE] and [QMGR] with the names of your queue and queue manager, or leave the queue manager unspecified (wmq:/msg/queue/[QUEUE]) to use the default queue manager (local or remote).

Credentials:
  ServerCredentials:
    # Optionally define credentials for use by the Integration Server.
    # Customize the CredentialType section for each type of credential that you want to create credentials for.
    # You must define each CredentialType at most once.
    # Each CredentialName must be unique within the CredentialType.
    # Each CredentialType has a set of allowable properties which are a subset of username, password, passphrase, apiKey, clientId, clientSecret, sshIdentityFile.
    # For full details of allowed CredentialTypes and their properties, refer to the Knowledge Center.
    # For example:
    # jdbc:
    #   USERDB:
    #     username: 'user1'
    #     password: 'myPassw0rd'
    #   OTHERDB:
    #     username: 'user2'
    #     password: 'myOtherPassw0rd'
    # rest:
    #   endpoint1:
    #     username: 'user1'
    #     password: 'myPassw0rd'
    #     apiKey: 'anApiKeyWhichMightBeALongOne'
    #
    #CredentialType:
      #CredentialName:
        #property: 'value'
        #property2: 'value2'

  ExternalCredentialsProviders:
    # Optionally define external credentials providers that are invoked on startup to load credentials for use by the Integration Server.
    # Copy and customize the ExternalProviderTemplate section for each external credential provider that you want to invoke.
    # Rename the section title 'ExternalProviderTemplate' to be the name of your external credential provider. This name must be unique.
    # Configure the loadAllCredentialsCommand to be the command, including arguments, that should be run to retrieve and return any credentials to be loaded.
    # The command can include environment variables and keywords that are replaced before execution to provide context specific configuration such as , [iib.system-work-dir], [iib.system-server-label]. Environment variables are replaced before keywords.
    # The command that is executed must output a stream of bytes to stdout that represent the credentials to be loaded in the configured format, either xml, json, or yaml, and in the configured codepage.
    # The command must return 0 when executing successfully, any other return value results in an error being reported and the returned output not being processed.
    # The properties loadAllCredentialsDirectErrorToCommandOutput and loadAllCredentialsIncludeCommandOutputInLogs are present for debugging and loadAllCredentialsIncludeCommandOutputInLogs should not be permanently set in production as it could result in credentials being leaked into logs.
    # When set to true the property loadAllCredentialsDirectErrorToCommandOutput results in " 2>&1" being appended to the command before execution so that stderr is redirected to the stdout stream. When set to false stderr ends up in the integration server stderr stream.
    #ExternalProviderTemplate:
      #loadAllCredentialsCommand: ''
      #loadAllCredentialsFormat: 'json'  # Format of the output returned by the command, Valid values are xml, json, or yaml. Default is json.
      #loadAllCredentialsCodepage: 1208  # Codepage of the output returned by the command. 0 means use the local codepage. Default is 1208.
      #loadAllCredentialsDirectErrorToCommandOutput: true   # Specify whether the stderr output of the command should be redirected to the stdout stream and read by the integration server. Default is true.
      #loadAllCredentialsIncludeCommandOutputInLogs: false  # Specify whether the output from the command should appear in log and user trace messages. Default is false.
      #loadAllCredentialsStopServerOnError: true            # Specify whether the server should stop if the command returns a non-zero exit code.  Default is true.

StartupScripts:
  # Optionally run scripts during server startup. These scripts can optionally return YANL to set environment and user variables in the server itself.
  # The optional return YAML format should start with the standard "---" as the first line (which is detected by the server with the default "auto"
  # setting below); the content should be the "UserVariables" or "EnvironmentVariables" stanzas from this file (see below for examples), or else the
  # Kubernetes standard "env" format:
